✅ How It Works
A user initiates a phone call to your Twilio number.

Twilio uses the provided webhook to stream audio.

The audio is converted to text and sent to GPT-4.

GPT-4 generates a natural language response.

The response is sent back as synthesized speech.

After the call, a summary is sent to WhatsApp.

📌 Future Enhancements
Add voice personalization

Store call history and transcripts

Deploy on AWS/GCP for production use
